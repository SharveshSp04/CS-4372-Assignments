Here is a link to the code in Google Colab : https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=AQPlxzWfvzJd&line=234&uniqifier=1
When this opens, run the code using the play button at the very beginning of the code. Then it will take awhile to download and run all the packages and when it asks for a file to input, choose the water_dataset.mat from the UCI ML Directory. if you canâ€™t find it then search for Water Quality Prediction and download it if it is not attached here or with the code separately.

Expected Output
When you run the program successfully, you should see:
Confirmation of package installation and import
File upload prompt (in Colab) or automatic detection (local)
Information about the dataset structure and variables
Basic statistical summary of the data
Multiple visualization plots showing data distribution and patterns
Advanced statistical analysis results
Confirmation of CSV file creation and download
